The raw OK-Seq data published in (Petryk, et al. Replication landscape of the human genome. Nature communications 7 (2016): 10208.) have been deposited at NCBI Sequence Read Archive with number SRP065949: https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?study=SRP065949.

And the processing RFD profiles (in bigwig format, 1 kb resolution, human genome version hg19) are available at: http://xfer.curie.fr/get/QDNUEVPev19/publish.OKSeq.Data.zip

You can also downlaod at the current folder the initiaton zones, termination zones and highRFD regions optained by the HMM process.
